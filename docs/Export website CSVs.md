# Export website CSVs

- In Access export CSVs for WebCatalogus.
	> Note: making a full export will mark those articles as exported in Access.
	> To prevent that, make the exports on a copy of the Access database.
	> Or, also import these CSVs into PrestaShop, otherwise future syncs will fail.
- Place all 3 files in `data/`.
- You can use these files for `convert-website-csvs` and other commands.
